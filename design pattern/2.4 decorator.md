# decorator

Decorator is basically a **wrapper**. When at runtime, extra behaviors are added without changing base code.

Decorator is used when it is not possible to use inheritance. It is a Composite with only one child.

    direction RL
    Component <-- BaseDecorator
    BaseDecorator <|.. ConcreteDecorator1
    BaseDecorator <|.. ConcreteDecorator2
    BaseDecorator <|.. ConcreteDecorator3
    class Component{
        +method()
    }
    class BaseDecorator{
        - component: Component
        +method()
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator1{
        +method()
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator2{
        +method()
    }
    class ConcreteDecorator3{
        +method()
    }
```
